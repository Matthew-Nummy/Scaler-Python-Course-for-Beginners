# Scaler-Python-Course-for-Beginners
### Answers to the coding challenges from the Scaler Python course. All answers had to pass a series of tests to be considered correct.

## Volume of a Sphere in Python
### You are given a positive integer r denoting the radius of a sphere as a parameter. Write a program to calculate the volume of the sphere. The volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.

## Leap Year?
### Given an integer A representing a year, Return 1 if it is a leap year else, return 0.

## Triangle Star-Pattern
### Write a function to print the pattern shown in the sample using n given as a parameter, where n defines the number of rows.

## Prime Finder
### Write a function to return True when the given function is a Prime number else False.

## Length of Unique Words
### Given two sentences, write a program to return the sum of the total number of unique words from each sentence.

## Get the Index
### Write a function to search for a given element elem in the tuple tup and return its index. Return -1 if elem is not present in tup.

## Divide the Tuple
### Write a program to divide a given tuple into two tuples that contain even and odd indexed elements of the original tuple. Print both these tuples in the given output format.

## Sum of Values
### Given a dictionary, find the sum of values of every key in the dictionary.

## Adding Common Keys
### Given two dictionaries, write a program for creating a dictionary in such a way that it consists of all the keys that are common in both dictionaries. The values corresponding to the keys in this new dictionary are the sum of the values of those keys in the two dictionaries.

## Frequency of Unique Elements
### Write a function to print out the frequency of all the unique elements present in a given tuple.

## Find the Area of a Circle
### Write a function to calculate and return the area of a circle by using the radius of the circle given as a parameter.

## Time to End Corona
### Given three integers, A, B and C. You have to find the number of days it will take to reach zero cases of Corona in a city.

A - Average cases recovered in a day of the corona.
B - Number of new cases of corona daily.
C - Current active cases of the corona.

Return the minimum number of days it will take to reach 0 active cases of Covid.
